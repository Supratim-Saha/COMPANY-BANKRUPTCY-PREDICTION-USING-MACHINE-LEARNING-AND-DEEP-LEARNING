# COMPANY-BANKRUPTCY-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-AND-DEEP-LEARNING
Predicting company bankruptcies is a critical task in financial risk management. This project 
explores the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop accurate 
bankruptcy prediction models. By leveraging financial indicators and performance metrics from 
historical data, the project aims to create robust models capable of identifying companies at risk 
of bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy prediction is an important problem in finance, as successful predictions enable 
stakeholders to take early actions to mitigate economic losses. Recent studies have investigated 
the application of machine learning models to bankruptcy prediction using financial ratios as 
predictors. This study extends this research by applying machine learning techniques to a 
quarterly dataset covering financial ratios for a large sample of public U.S. firms from 1970â€“
2019.
The objectives of this project include data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and 
the implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, 
Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting. 
Additionally, deep learning models including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), SimpleRNN, 
and LSTM are employed to assess their effectiveness in bankruptcy prediction.
Furthermore, the project includes extensive model evaluation and comparison to identify the 
best-performing algorithms for bankruptcy prediction. The outcome of this project provides 
valuable insights for stakeholders, investors, and financial institutions to make informed 
decisions and take preventive measures against potential bankruptcies.
Through the integration of finance, data analytics, and machine learning, this project aims to 
contribute to the field of financial risk management by providing accurate and timely 
bankruptcy predictions.
